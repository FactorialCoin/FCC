FCC Wallet script
Development Version

Copy all files to the same wallet directory as the normal version.

The Start_Wallet scripts can be copied to others in where you change the wallet port.
This way you can start more than one miner, while you use the same FCC wallet file, for example. 

The trusted.nodes file is for now a fix to get your wallet started beyond the nodelist fails what seems to occure at more places. We are still fixing that issue.
