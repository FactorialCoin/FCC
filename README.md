FCC Source Code

FCC is completely made in Perl. It will run on almost any O/S.
It allows to participate in one of the fastest and most secure Crypto Currencies on planet earth.
You can earn FCC by mining it or running a node in which case you will get part of the fees payed over transactions.

Install:

put all gxxx.pm (except global.pm) into your .../perl/site/lib directory
and all other pm's into a new /perl/site/lib/FCC directory.

Put walletserver.cgi and wallet.htm in a directory FCC/wallet and all images in FCC/wallet/image

(I hope to simplify this when I'm less tired, how the freak do you make subdirs on github?!)

May the FCC take you down the rabbithole, say hello to Alice from me!

Chaosje.
