FCC Source Code

FCC is completely made in Perl. It will run on almost any O/S.
It allows to participate in one of the fastest and most secure Crypto Currencies on planet earth.
You can earn FCC by mining it or running a node in which case you will get part of the fees payed over transactions.

Install:

put all gxxx.pm (except global.pm) into your .../perl/site/lib directory
and all other pm's into a new /perl/site/lib/FCC dirctory.

(I hope to simplify this when I'm less tired)

May the FCC take you down the rabbithole, say hello to Alice from me!

Chaosje.
