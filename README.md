FCC Source Code

FCC is completely made in Perl. It will run on almost any O/S.
It allows to participate in one of the fastest and most secure Crypto Currencies on planet earth.
You can earn FCC by mining it or running a node in which case you will get part of the fees payed over transactions.

The file strcuture should be kinda self-explanatory.

May the FCC take you down the rabbithole, say hello to Alice from me!

Chaosje.
